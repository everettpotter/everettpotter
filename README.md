## 🦌 About Me

I'm a driven computer science student with a concentration in cybersecurity and a strong foundation in finance. I'm currently pursuing an accelerated MBA to further bridge the gap between technical solutions and business strategy.

My goal is to apply these skills in impactful ways by building efficient, secure, and scalable systems. I'm actively preparing for internships at top-tier tech companies with a focus on full-stack development and AI/ML.

Outside of tech, I enjoy training for Ironman and ultramarathon events, lifting weights, and reading. These passions fuel both my discipline and personal growth.
